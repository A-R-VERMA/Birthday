        <h3>
            You have always been by my side. You care about us so much. You never <br><br>think about yourself and put others before you. You do so much for us. You <br><br>are daring, brave, smart, awesome, kind and funny. There is not a single <br><br>birthday gift in the world that can be worth your contribution in our life. I am <br><br>so lucky to have such great father like you. I will always cherish all the <br><br>priceless lessons you have given me. No matter how hard I try, no matter <br><br>what I do, I would never be able to thank you far enough for all your love <br><br>and care you filled my life with. You are my hero, my icon. You are like a <br><br>large tree which gives fruit, shade and flowers to the whole family. Thank <br><br>you for everything. Wishing you a great and happy birthday.
